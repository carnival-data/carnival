# Carnival Clinical

**Carnival Clinical** is an extension **Carnival Core** for clinical data.

Inspired by Open Biological and Biomedical Ontology (OBO) Foundry ontologies, the **carnival-clinical** extension of the **Carnival** data model supports the execution of common investigatory tasks including harmonizing complex patient, specimen and healthcare information, patient cohort identification, case-control matching, and the production of data sets for scientific analysis.
