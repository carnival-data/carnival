# Developer Setup

_This documentation is applicable for developing the core Carnival framework, not developing an application that uses Carnival._

**Carnival** is a [Groovy](https://groovy-lang.org) multi-project that uses [Gradle](https://gradle.org) as the build engine. The main project is in the app directory. Folders within app contain the sub-projects (eg. app/carnival-core). Every sub-project has a build.gradle configuration file that defines its dependencies and the gradle tasks that it can execute. The build.gradle file in the app directory defines project-wide configuration. Gradle task commands executed from the root project filter down to the sub-projects. Gradle commands referenced in this documentation are assumed to be called from the root project directory carnival/app unless otherwise noted. This project also includes a Docker image configuration that can be built to run the Carnival test suite.

## Installation

### Java JDK

If you do not already have one, install the Java JDK. We recommend [Amazon Corretto](https://aws.amazon.com/corretto/), Java 8 or above.

### Github

1. If you do not already have one, create a free account on [Github](https://github.com).
1. Install [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com).
1. Clone the [Carnival repository from Github](https://github.com/pmbb-ibi/carnival).

### Carnival Home

Set up a Carnival home directory, which will be used to contain data files and override the default Carnival configuration.

1. Create an empty directory named `carnival_home`.
2. Set an environment variable `CARNIVAL_HOME` to the `path/to/carnival_home`.
3. Create an empty `config` directory in the the carnival home directory.
4. Copy `application.yml-template` and `logback.yml-template` from `carnival/config` to `carnival_home/config`.
5. Remove the `-template` file name suffix from each file.

**Note** - In the config files windows paths should be specified using double forward-slashes (i.e. `C://Users//myuser//somedirectory`).

#### Configuration Files

| Name             | Description                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| application.yaml | Contains data source information (i.e. credentals to relational dbs, RDF dbs, REDCap, etc.), the default vine cache-mode, local directory configuration and the gremlin configuration. |
| logback.xml      | Can be modified to change the log levels.                                                                                                                                              |

### Neo4j APOC _(optional)_

Awesome Procedures on Cypher (APOC) is a library of Neo4j procedures. While Carnival does not depend on any of these procedures, it may be useful to install the library.

1. Download the most recent 3.5+ release from the [Neo4j Github](https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-apoc-procedures/releases).

2. Add the path to that directory in gremlin section of the application.yaml config file in the entry gremlin:neo4j:conf:dbms:directories:plugins:

```yaml
# gremlin
gremlin:
    neo4j:
        conf:
            dbms:
                directories:
                    plugins: /Users/myuser/Documents/Neo4j/default.graphdb/plugins
                security:
                    auth_enabled: "false"
                    procedures:
                        unrestricted: apoc.*
                        whitelist: apoc.*
```

### Installation Test

1. Open a Command Prompt.
2. `cd` to the carnival repository directory.
3. `cd app`
4. `gradlew clean`
5. `gradlew compileGroovy`

## Compiling

Carnival can be built by running gradle compileGroovy . The build can be cleaned by running gradle clean . To run sub-project tasks, use the gradle colon syntax: gradle :carnival- util:compileGroovy .

## Testing

Gradle is used to execute the test suite. Running tests produces html test result files in the sub-project directories `carnvial\app\carnival-\*\build\reports\tests\test\index.html` .

### Aggregating Test Results

Running the command gradle testReport will run all tests and generate aggregated results in `carnival\app\build\reports\allTests` .

### Common Test Commands

To run tests for all gradle sub-projects: `gradlew test`
To run tests for all gradle sub-projects and aggrigate the results: `gradlew testReport`
To run tests in a specific gradle sub-project: `gradlew :carnival-util:test`
To run a specific test suite, in this example the tests located in `carnival\app\carnival-graph/src/test/groovy/carnival/graph/VertexDefTraitSpec.groovy` :
`gradle :carnival-graph:test --tests "carnival.graph.VertexDefTraitSpec"`

### HTTP Tests

Some of the tests require external HTTP resources. To run these tests:
`gradlew -Dtest-http=true :carnival-core:test`

### Running Tests using Docker

The test suite can be run in the context of a docker image. If running tests in this way gradle does not need to be installed, and any configuration in the users CARNIVAL_HOME directory will be ignored.

## Docker

Most recent stable release, minimum version is 17.06.0
Official Docker Website Getting Started
Official Docker Installation for Windows
Docker-Compose (Version 1.22.0 or greater, Linux only) - Separate installation is only needed for linux, docker-compose is bundled with windows and mac docker installations Linux Docker-Compose Installation

### Running Tests in the Docker Environment

First build the docker image using the command: `docker-compose -f .\docker-compose-test.yml build`
Once built, the tests can be run using the command: `docker-compose -f .\docker-compose-test.yml up --force-recreate`
This has the same effect as running gradle testReports, and the aggregated test results will be in the folder `carnival\app\build\reports\allTests` .

## Publishing Libraries to Local Maven Repository

The Groovy sub-project modules can be published to local maven repositories by running commands like the following:

```
gradlew :carnival-util:publishToMavenLocal
gradlew :carnival-core:publishToMavenLocal
```

To publish all modules:

```
gradlew publishAll
```
