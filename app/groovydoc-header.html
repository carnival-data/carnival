    <b>Carnival</b> is a semantically driven informatics toolkit that enables
    the aggregation of data from disparate sources into a unified property
    graph and provides mechanisms to model and interact with property graph
    data in well-defined ways.
</p>
<p>
    There are two main components to Carnival. The first is a data caching
    mechanism that supports the efficient aggregation of data from disparate
    sources. The second is a layer built on top of
    <a href="https://tinkerpop.apache.org">Apache Tinkerpop</a> that seeks to
    provide more standardized and semantically driven methods of interacting
    with a property graph.
