# Carnival

*It's a party of information!*

**Carnival** is a data unification technology that enables the aggregation of data from disparate sources into a unified property graph and provides tools to reason over and interact with graph data using bounded operations. **Carnival** has a robust architecture for tracking the provenance of data and providing evidence chains for conclusions or reasoning made on those data.

## <a name="overview"></a> Overview

Carnival uses objects called _vines_ to connect to external data sources and _reapers_ encode the domain knowledge specific to that data source. Vines can connect to sources such as MySql or Oracle databases, RedCap projects, and CSV files. Some vine features include:

-   Parameterized SQL queries
-   Utilities to compose iterative SQL from lists of identifiers and codes
-   Caching of query results
-   Incremental caching of long running query result data
-   Monitor thread to estimate time to completion of long running queries
-   Automatic re-establishment of dropped connections
-   API layer for REDCap
-   H2 database wrapper for CSV data

Carnivalâ€™s property graph database:

-   Is inherently schema-less enabling the incorporation of new data without restructuring resident data
-   Follows data instantiation patterns built for computational efficiency and inspired by OBO Foundry ontologies
-   Has a query engine capable of executing queries of arbitrary complexity
