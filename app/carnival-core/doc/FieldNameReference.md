# Glossary
* SPS - the name of our inventory system.  SPS_LAB_ID is one of the collection event identifiers that is used in this system.

* PK - In the context of a field with a name like 'MATCH_PK_PATIENT_ID__170901', this means 'primary key'.  This field represents an internal patient identifier that is generated by PDS.  The identifier changes over time, but for any given query should be consistent (no two people should have the same pk_patient_id).  The date is included in this field name to give some scope as to when the field was generated.

* EMR - Electronic Medical Record.  In this case, it refers to data we have access to in Penn Data Store, which is a data warehouse built from various sources including EPIC and MedView.

* PDS - Penn Data Store.  In this context, synonomous with PDS.

* ENC - Health care encounter in PDS.

* RCMT - Biobank recruitment event.

* LT - Less then.  For example, TC_LAB_LT_RCMT_MOSTRECENT refers to the most recent Total Cholesterol lab value that occurred before the biobank recruitment date.

* LTEQ - Less then or equal to.  For example, 'EMR_TOBACCO_LTEQ_RCMT' refers to the most recent tobacco related social history entry in the EMR that occurred before or on the biobank recruitment date.
