# Carnival

**Carnival** is a data unification technology that enables the aggregation of data from disparate sources into a unified property graph and provides tools to reason over and interact with graph data using bounded operations. **Carnival** has a robust architecture for tracking the provenance of data and providing evidence chains for conclusions or reasoning made on those data.
